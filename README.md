# Traffic-Sign-Detection
This repository contains the code for a Traffic Sign Detection model built using Detectron2. [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) is Facebook AI Research's next-generation library that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms. It is the successor to [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) and [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark). Detectron2 supports a wide range of computer vision research projects and production applications at Facebook.

The Traffic Sign Detection model leverages Detectron2's advanced capabilities to accurately identify and classify traffic signs in images. This implementation demonstrates the application of cutting-edge computer vision techniques to a practical problem
